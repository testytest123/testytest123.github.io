The year was 2001. Personal computers were on the rise and software was in high demand with various project management frameworks already in use by development teams across the world. Apple had not long released the Power Mac Cube (one of their last major product failures) and were preparing for the launch of the first ever iPod. Meanwhile, 700 miles away in a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah, 17 software developers were meeting to discuss the future of software development. Little did they know, this meeting (and many more) would go on to change the way that Apple, and so many others, develop the products, websites and software that we use to this day. 

Being familiar with the different lightweight development methodologies of the time (SCRUM, Crystal etc), the founders of “agile” sought to create a [manifesto](https://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/agile-manifesto) of the best practices and values for improving the effectiveness of software development. These values had a focus on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over following a plan. These values and principles have gone on to influence the various project management frameworks that are used today.
