title: "A Brief History of Agile"
---

The year was 2001. Personal computers were on the rise and software was in high demand with various project management frameworks already in use by development teams across the world. Apple had not long released the Power Mac Cube (one of their last major product failures) and were preparing for the launch of the first ever iPod. Meanwhile, 700 miles away in a ski resort in Snowbird, Utah, 17 software developers were meeting to discuss the future of software development. Little did they know, this meeting (and many more) would go on to change the way that Apple, and so many others, develop the products, websites and software that we use to this day. 

Being familiar with the different lightweight development methodologies of the time (SCRUM, Crystal etc), the founders of “agile” sought to create a [manifesto](https://www.scrumalliance.org/resources/agile-manifesto) of the best practices and values for improving the effectiveness of software development. These values have a focus on:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

They also defined the principles for incremental development that define the basis for a successful product:

1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
