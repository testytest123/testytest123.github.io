Before we get into the differences of each, we need to understand the history of Scrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;origins-of-scrum&quot;&gt;Origins of Scrum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, all projects used to be managed using the Waterfall approach where the flow followed the gathering of requirements, design, implementation, testing and eventually deployment and maintenance of a product but as personal computing and software began to grow in popularity, this approach was considered time consuming and rigid, making it difficult to introduce new changes to the project. It was for this reason that development teams decided that customer collaboration and an improved response to change was required in order for a product to succeed. This is when various frameworks similar to Scrum began popping up in the industry around the same time that all shared the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrumwithme.com/about/&quot;&gt;values and principles&lt;/a&gt;  translated into a series of different processes and roles within a company that help teams structure and manage their work. These values and principles would later go on to become known as “Agile”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview of the Scrum model allows us to break down the framework into 5 steps or phases that are enforced by the Scrum Master and adhear to the Agile way of working. These are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-backlog&quot;&gt;Product Backlog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product backlog is a list of tasks that are derived from the product roadmap and are broken down and prioritised with the most important items at the top of the list. Prioritising these tasks gives each member of the team a sense of direction and helps to enforce the idea of a self managed team. The product backlog itself is owned by the Product Owner who is responsible for the product roadmap and has a clear understanding of what features will require development first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sprint-planning&quot;&gt;Sprint Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No sprint is ready to begin without a planning session to kick things off. This is required to determine what the development team is capable of delivering within the sprint, whether this be one or two weeks or another time limit altogether. Sprint planning normally requires the whole scrum team to contribute and commit to the level of work that is being set out as well as agreeing on a goal or goals for the sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-on-a-sprint&quot;&gt;Working on a sprint&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout an active sprint, the development team will attend ‘stand up’ meetings on a daily basis in order to check in and give an update on their current status. This helps the product owner to track progress of development / testing and highlights any impediments the team might have encountered. It is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to try and resolve any impediments that might impact the team’s ability to deliver the sprint goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-demonstration&quot;&gt;Product Demonstration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product demo is essential for keeping stakeholders updated with the progress of product development and allows them to give feedback on any possible amendments to the product backlog that might be required to maximise the value of the product. This feedback should then be taken into consideration when planning the next sprint. The demo will be attended by the entire Scrum team as well as any stakeholders and management that have an input on the product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retrospective&quot;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The retrospective is a timeboxed meeting that takes place after the sprint is complete with the purpose of reviewing the success of each sprint. Each member of the team is encouraged to speak freely on matters related to people, relationships, processes and tools. These issues are then voted on in terms of popularity and the highest voted items are discussed in order of most popular to least popular as a way of identifying and addressing the more significant issues first opposed to those that only impact certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the main difference is that Agile can be considered more of a philosophy to project management whereas Scrum (and all the other frameworks that are based on the same values and principles) are frameworks used to put this philosphy into practice. In the end, there is no Scrum without Agile.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Scott McLintock</name></author><category term="Agile," /><category term="Waterfall," /><category term="Scrum" /><summary type="html">‘Agile’ and ‘Scrum’ are two terms that often go hand in hand and are often confused for being the same thing, but what actually are the main differences between the two?

It’s one of the most frequently debated topics in the industry along with Windows vs Mac, Manual vs Automated or Front End vs Back End (and let’s not forget Full Stack) but what difference has it made given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that 93% of companies that had implemented an “agile” model prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were more successful than those that hadn’t. This demonstrates that frequent releases and updates are essential with the economy struggling to get back on its feet as a result of the pandemic but exactly how has an “agile” mindset helped businesses get through the past couple of years of lockdowns and working from home? Why is it worth transitioning from a Waterfall approach if you haven’t already done so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adapting-to-change&quot;&gt;Adapting to Change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that Agile is particularly well suited for is adapting to change with it being one of the four core values of the Agile methodology. With lockdowns impacting not just how we work but the work itself, companies have been left on the edge of their seats watching the news for restriction changes around the world. In the cinema industry, for example, seating restrictions and social distancing rules have been implemented and lifted numerous times throughout lockdown with many theatres being forced to close altogether, opening with a only few days notice to get ready with the new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Agile, customer input is welcomed throughout the development process with effective communication being the key to staying on top of the ever changing restrictions. Reviewing the Product Backlog (the breakdown of work) on a regular basis makes it easier to prioritise tasks when these changes occur. This can result in new tasks entering the Sprint (a time-boxed period where work should be completed) and can sometimes alter the goals of a Sprint entirely. Using an “agile” approach such as Scrum makes this achievable over the Waterfall methodology due to the use of daily and weekly meetings like Stand Ups, Sprint Planning and Retrospectives that make sure everyone is aware of the ever changing requirements that are expected of them and ensures that everyone’s voice is heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;self-organised-teams&quot;&gt;Self Organised Teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Agile Methodology promotes self organised teams who are responsible for assigning and tracking their own work and progress. This is beneficial to a business in a number of ways as it cuts down on the necessary resources and overhead that are often associated with  micro-managing. It also encourages developers to become more enthusiastic towards their work by creating a sense of ownership and introducing a happier working environment where employees feel trusted to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For self organised teams to succeed it is important to offer motivation and support through acknowledgment and recognition, team building exercises and introducing an element of fun to the workplace. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://company.boxoffice.com&quot;&gt;The Boxoffice Company&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the employees have stayed motivated working from home by encouraging virtual movie nights, quizzes and making plans for a time where we can once again meet up for our annual BBQ. Prior to working from home, a fun office environment was introduced with table tennis and Mario Kart tournaments ensuring the workplace was always a welcome environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the Waterfall methodology there is nothing stopping you from encouraging a fun and relaxed environment but this can often feel a lot more like forced fun when the workload and ownership is delegated and ‘wins’ (such as product launches) are far and few between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a moment to reflect on your current place of work. How well do they cope with change and communication? How do they encourage ownership and enthusiasm in the work that you do? What constitutes a win? No working environment is entirely perfect, especially one in the midst of a pandemic, but it is the drive to improve and adapt that makes them truly “agile”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Scott McLintock</name></author><category term="Agile," /><category term="Waterfall," /><category term="Pandemic" /><summary type="html">When studying the Agile methodology, the Waterfall model (in which progress flows downwards through design, development and deployment until you reach product completion) is one that is hard to escape when transitioning from a “traditional” project management approach to one such as Scrum (the continuous cycle of delivering progress).

You have just taken the first step in learning how to work together to create effective and successful products. Together, we’re going to learn the ins and outs of the “agile” development process whilst reviewing the different frameworks with a focus on Scrum in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked in various roles within the digital sector covering all aspects of the product life cycle from digital design, front end devlopment, quality assurance and product ownership. I have also worked across various Agile and Waterfall based companies and it is for this reason I have gained an appreciation for Scrum and all that it has to offer. I am now starting a new journey in my career with the intention of becoming a certified Scrum Master working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://company.boxoffice.com&quot;&gt;The Boxoffice Company&lt;/a&gt; and invite you to join me as I share all that I learn and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-scrum-master&quot;&gt;What is a Scrum Master?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum and it is their responsibility to help the other members of their team to understand Scrum as well as helping to constantly improve the practices and processes of day to day activities within the workplace. This can range from coaching team members to working alongside the Product Owner to effectively manage the Product Backlog as well as various other Scrum related responsibilities. Exactly what this means and how it is achieved will be described in detail throughout this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrum Master certification is split into 3 levels that determine a person’s knowledge on the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-i-certification&quot;&gt;PSM level I&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates a fundamental level of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-ii-certification&quot;&gt;PSM level II&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates an advanced level of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-iii-certification&quot;&gt;PSM level III&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates a distinguished level of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
