I was recently approached by a manager of a company (who shall remain anonymous) and told they had problems with team communication while working on projects from home. They said that their main problem was having no idea what their team was doing and was on the verge of telling their staff to go into the office more frequently for meetings to improve the communication. I suggested an alternative option that would still allow the team to work from home would be to introducing some simple Agile principles that aren't hard to stick to and can work for any type of project. Below is the guideline I shared with them that hopefully can be of some use to anyone else in a similar situation:

## Kick Off Meeting (essential)
When a project first starts, a one hour kick off meeting should be held before starting to ensure the following items are met:

• Everyone knows the requirements of the project

• You have everything you need to achieve the project goals or know how to approach anything that is still outstanding 

• The team all know where the retrospective board is and how to add to it

## Stand Up Meeting (essential)
Every working day of the project life cycle there should be a 15 minute meeting held at the end of each day. This meeting should go through every member of the team alphabetically where they give a brief update of the following items in 30 seconds or less: 

• Main tasks they have achieved that day or what they were unable to achieve 

• What they plan to achieve tomorrow 

• What is standing in the way of achieving this (blockers)

It’s important to acknowledge this meeting is about spreading awareness of what people are doing and not holding people accountable for committing to certain tasks every day. If they did not achieve the tasks they said they would, this is an opportunity to learn why so you can try to resolve it as a team. 

## Retrospective Meeting (essential)
As mentioned previously, a retrospective board is set up at the start of every project where all team members can add their thoughts to throughout the project. These may consist of things they thought went well, things that did not go well, ideas for improvement, acknowledgements etc. The retrospective meeting should take place after the project is complete and last an hour. The manager or Scrum Master should lead this meeting and encourage a positive space where the following actions should occur: 

• Group any items that reference the same thing

• Vote on the most popular to talk about (you will most likely not get through everything in the hour so it’s helpful to discuss the items that get the most votes first)

• Set a timer of 5 or 10 minutes (depending on group size) where you discuss each item and record actions of what to take away from the discussion

## Virtual Morning Coffee Meeting (optional)
As with the stand up meeting at the end of every day, a 15 minute virtual morning coffee meeting at the start of each day can be helpful where you discuss no work matters at all. This is an optional space for people to attend if they wish to to say hello with a tea or coffee virtually, discuss their weekend or evening and generally register the fact they are online in much the same way you would greet colleagues in an office environment when starting your day. This meeting is purely about improving colleague satisfaction in order to add some normality to working from home.
