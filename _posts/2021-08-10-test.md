Congratulations! You have just taken the first step in learning how to work together to create effective and successful products. Together, we’re going to learn the ins and outs of the “agile” development process whilst reviewing the different frameworks with a focus on Scrum in particular. This blog is intended to offer the required knowledge for not only improving the product development process within your team, but will also provide you with the required skills for becoming a certified Scrum Master. 

## What is a Scrum Master?

Put simply, the Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum and it is their responsibility to help the other members of their team to understand Scrum as well as helping to constantly improve the practices and processes of day to day activities within the workplace. This can range from coaching team members to working alongside the Product Owner to effectively manage the Product Backlog as well as various other Scrum related responsibilities. Exactly what this means and how it is achieved will be described in detail throughout this blog. 

Scrum Master certification is split into 3 levels that determine a person's knowledge of the subject: 

1. [PSM level I](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-i-certification) demonstrates a fundamental level of understanding. 
2. [PSM level II](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-ii-certification) demonstrates an advanced level of understanding. 
3. [PSM level III](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-master-iii-certification) demonstrates a distinguished level of understanding.
